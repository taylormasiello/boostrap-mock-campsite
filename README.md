# Nucampsite - A Project with Bootstrap

I'm currently a student at Nucamp, an online coding bootcamp. This was our first class portfolio project, in which we made a mock campsite as we learned Bootstrap. I'm learning how to use GitHub as well, so this is my first time uploading a completed project, so I hope I uploaded the correct files...we'll see. I hope to use GitHub more traditionally with my next project, instead of waiting until the project was completed to add it to a repository.
