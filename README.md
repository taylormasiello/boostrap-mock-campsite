# Nucampsite - A Project with Bootstrap

I'm currently a student at Nucamp, an online coding bootcamp. This was our first class portfolio project, in which we made a mock campsite website as we learned Bootstrap. I'm learning how to use GitHub as well, so this is my first time uploading a completed project. Hopefully I uploaded the correct files...we'll see. I hope to use GitHub more traditionally with my next project, instead of waiting until the project is completed to upload it all at once to a repository.

Lessons Learned During Nucamp's Bootstrap Module (among others): 

* Front-End UI Frameworks
* Responsive Web Design
* Bootstrap Grid system
* Customizing Bootstrap
* Color and Spacing Utility Classes
* Navigation
* Icon Fonts, Buttons, and Forms
* Tables and Cards
* Images and Media
* Tabs and Pills
* Collapse and Accordion
* Tooltips and Modals
* Carousel
* Bootstrap and jQuery
* CSS Preprocessors
* (Overview of) Building and Deployment
